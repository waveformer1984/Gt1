- **P**erformance-optimized layouts

## Lead System: Hydi Integration
All hardware designs integrate with Hydi voice AI control for:
- Voice-activated power management
- Wireless configuration updates
- Performance monitoring feedback
- Emergency safety protocols

## Quick Start
1. Review schematic files in respective component folders
2. Check 3D model compatibility with your fabrication setup
3. Validate power requirements against battery specifications
4. Test wireless communication range and reliability

## Contributing
- Follow KiCad standards for schematics
- Use FreeCAD/Fusion360 for 3D models
- Document all design changes in component READMEs
- Test prototypes before submitting designs
