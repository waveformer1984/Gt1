# 3D Models - REZONATE Hardware Design

## Overview
3D printable and manufactureable models for REZONATE wearable instrument components.

## Model Categories

### 🎵 Wearable Components
- Neck harp housing and string guides
- Ergonomic shoulder/neck attachments
- Cable management systems
- Quick-release mechanisms

### 🚁 Drone Modules
- Lightweight speaker enclosures
- Aerodynamic shell designs
- Mounting bracket systems
- Battery compartment integration

### 🦵 Support Structures

## File Formats
- **STL**: For 3D printing
- **STEP**: For manufacturing
- **OBJ**: For visualization
- **FBX**: For animation/simulation

## Design Requirements
- **Weight**: Minimize for wearability
- **Durability**: Performance use resistance
- **Ergonomics**: User comfort priority
- **Modularity**: Interchangeable components

## 3D Printing Guidelines
```
Print Settings:
├── Layer Height: 0.2mm
├── Infill: 20-40% (component dependent)
├── Material: PETG/ABS for durability
├── Supports: Minimal/tree supports
└── Post-processing: Sanding/vapor smooth
```

## Manufacturing Specifications
- **Injection Molding**: High volume production
- **CNC Machining**: Precision components
- **Cast Urethane**: Small batch prototyping
- **Metal Fabrication**: Structural elements
