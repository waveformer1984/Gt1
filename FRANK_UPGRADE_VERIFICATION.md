## 🔍 **External SSD Verification Methods**

### **Method 1: Host-Level Detection**
```bash
# On the physical Frank system (not in container):
lsblk -f                    # List all block devices
lsusb                       # USB device detection
fdisk -l                    # Partition tables
df -h                       # Mounted filesystems
dmesg | grep -i usb         # USB connection logs
```

### **Method 2: Mount Point Detection**
```bash
# Check if SSD is mounted at specific location:
ls -la /media/*/            # Media mount points
ls -la /mnt/*/              # Manual mount points
mount | grep -E "(ssd|external|usb)"  # Active mounts
```

### **Method 3: Device by UUID/Label**
```bash
# Check for specific drive identification:
ls -la /dev/disk/by-uuid/   # UUID-based identification
ls -la /dev/disk/by-label/  # Label-based identification
blkid                       # Block device attributes
```
