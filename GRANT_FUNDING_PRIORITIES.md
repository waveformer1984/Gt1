### Patent Application Schedule

#### Week 1-2: Provisional Patent Filings
1. **Magnetic Transport System** - $320 USPTO fee + $1,000 attorney
2. **HYDI Voice Coordination** - $320 USPTO fee + $1,000 attorney  
3. **Automation Engine Architecture** - $320 USPTO fee + $1,000 attorney
4. **Discovery Algorithm Framework** - $320 USPTO fee + $1,000 attorney
5. **Graphene Neural Interface** - $320 USPTO fee + $1,000 attorney

**Total Immediate Cost**: $6,600 for complete provisional protection

#### Month 12: Full Patent Applications
- Convert provisionals to full applications
- Estimated $15K-$20K per patent
- Grant funding should cover these costs

### Development Security Protocol

#### Allowed Activities (Private Only)
- Localhost development and optimization
- Grant application preparation
- Patent documentation drafting
- Internal testing and validation
- Nonprofit fundraising (research-focused)

#### Prohibited Until Patents Filed
- Public deployment to any domain
- Technical demonstrations or presentations
- Detailed implementation discussions
- Code repositories (public)
- Marketing with technical specifications

### Revenue Protection Strategy

#### Phase 1: Grant-Funded Development (Months 1-6)
- Focus entirely on grant acquisition
- Use funds for patent protection
- Maintain private development
- Build grant portfolio for future funding

#### Phase 2: Protected Deployment (Months 6-12)
- Deploy only after provisional patents filed
- Limited technical disclosure
- Revenue generation with IP protection
- Scale based on patent prosecution funding

#### Phase 3: Full Commercialization (Year 2+)
- Complete patent portfolio
- Public deployment and marketing
- Full revenue realization
- Technology licensing opportunities

### Immediate Action Items

1. **File provisional patents** (Week 1 priority)
2. **Submit DoD SBIR application** (highest funding potential)
3. **Launch CHDR donation campaign** (immediate funding)
4. **Continue private development** (maintain localhost-only)
5. **Prepare full patent applications** (12-month deadline)

**Total Funding Target for IP Protection**: $75,000-$125,000
**Primary Sources**: DoD SBIR ($300K), NIH STTR ($500K), NSF I-Corps ($50K)
